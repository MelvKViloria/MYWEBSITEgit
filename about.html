    <h2>Dualist</h2>
    <p>Duelists are the sharp end of the stick in Valorant, built to strike hard and fast. Their kit is tailored for aggressive play, focused on dealing damage and securing kills. With abilities like flashes, stuns, and repositioning skills, Duelists are experts at making their own opportunities.</p>

       <p> Duelists are often the star performers of a team, expected to lead the charge and rack up kills. They are self-sufficient "lone wolves," capable of creating their own success. But even the best Duelists know when to ask for help. By communicating with teammates, they can maximize their effectiveness and clear areas more efficiently.</p>
        
        <p>As a Duelist, your primary job is to make space for your team. You'll be the first one in, taking risks and getting kills to pave the way for your teammates. Whether you're playing aggressively to create a thrilling pace or methodically checking every corner, you're the one setting the tone for the match.</p>
        
        <p>To be a successful Duelist, you'll need excellent aim, quick reflexes, and good game sense. But the best Duelists also know when to pull back and play defensively. Balancing aggression and caution is the key to dominating a game.</p>
        
    <p>Currently, there are six Duelists in Valorant: Reyna, Jett, Phoenix, Neon, Yoru, and Raze. If you're looking to become a Duelist, be prepared to fight. Constantly training your aim and honing your skills will help you come out on top in the heat of battle. Remember, Valorant is a team game, and even the best Duelists need their teammates to succeed.</p>
